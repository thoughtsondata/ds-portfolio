## Welcome to my portfolio.
Below you can find a number of my personal projects that I've worked on recently. They tackle data science and analysis issues with machine learning, plotting, and/or data exploration techniques.

**Note**: These projects are in chronological order, so the higher a project is, the newer it is.

### AirBnB Price Checker

This project consist of a dash app that utilizes a keras model to predict the price of an airbnb listing based on key paramaters. The data was first explored, cleaned, and visualized with the goal in mind. After determining that the data was fit for analysis, a keras model was built and then implimented into the dash app. The projects code can be found [here](https://github.com/tt-dsft-45-AirBnb).

### Chess Analyzed

The goal of this analysis is to pinpoint optimal, and popoular sets of moves in the game of chess. This is achieved via feature extraction and visualization. After the initial anlysis, a random forest classifier model is instantiated to predict the probability of a player winning based on their elo, piece color, and initial moves.

### Rent Regression

Rent Regression establishes a prediction of apartments in nyc listed on renthop.com. To achieve this I performed data analysis to determine an ideal way to structure the data for use in a regression model. After the model creation, I validated my findings through the use of regression metrics.
